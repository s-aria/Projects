C)We run the system for couple of crunch times and see how it evolves and
make that into a short movie.
The movie is for 200 particles for t'=3. We observe that the
collapse happens at t'= 1 and by t'=1.5 the explosive expansion
has been slowed down. By this point all the bound particles are 
in state of equilibrium.

D)
We study a system of 10,50,100, 150 and 200 particles. We want to see
how the size of the cluster relates to the varius quantities we measure.
We set a condition for ejection which is all particles that venture outside
of a sphere with radius 45 ly. We then count the particles within our sphere
and see a near constant ratio of bound particles  versus ejected particles. 
[Total: Ejected|200: 49|150:40|100: 24|50: 16|10: 4]
We start with 40% ejection rate for 10 particles, then 32%, then 24%, then 26.6% and
lastly 24.5%.
With this we also measure the energy of the ejected particles versus the energy of the
total system and observe:
100.33% of the systems total energy for 200 particles
100.9% of the systems total energy for 150 particles
100.02% of the systems total energy for 100 particles
119.28% of the systems total energy for 50 particles
100.59% of the systems total energy for 10 particles
Only the energies of 50 particle system stands out, with lower system energy than otherwise expected.
However we observe the larger trend where we have a very large part of the systems energy in the 
ejected particles.

On the conservation of the energy in the system:
The energy is not conserved, we start out with a negative total energy 
due to the kinetic energy being zero. We end up with huge kinetic energy
for the system once the particles start interacting and some of them are
ejected. We plot the kinetic and potential energy and see that for
some particles their kinetic energy is 100s of times larger than their
potential energy. Due to the kinetic energy being proportional to
v^2 we can easily see which particles are ejected by their kinetic energy.
But this is not all, we also observe that for the ejected particles, their
kinetic energy remains near constant, which tells us that it has escaped
far enough to not be pulled in by the gravitational force which is proportional
to 1/r^2. Which if we ignore the force between the ejected particles 
is the radius to the center mass of the bound particles.

We study the 200 particle simulation, here we observe that there are sharp increase
in kinetic energy between t*=0.5 and 1.5. However most of these are exponentially 
decreasing after their maxima. This, we hypothisize, is due to the density of particles
in the area of the sphere this takes place. Our hypothesis is further strengthened by
the decreasing likelihood of their appearence as time moves towards crunch time and beyond.
We understand this is due to the large force that now acts on these over smaller distance
it's more difficult to escape than when the particles were scattered uniformly in the sphere.
As we reach equilibrium we see that these sharp increases have disappeared completely, and we
conclude that it must be because of the mass concentrated in the center of the cluster and the 
total force that acts on particles so close to the center of the cluster.



For 200 particles:
49 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
(59034500-(-195315))/59034500=100.33% of the systems total energy.

for 150 particles:
40 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
(1.80142E7-(-162929))/1.80142E7=100.9% of the systems total energy.

for 100 particles:
24 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
(6.01792E8-(-109020))/6.01792E8=100.02% of the systems total energy.


for 50 particles:
16 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
(206040-(-39725.8))/206040=119.28% of the systems total energy.


for 10 particles:
4 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
(40311.6-(-237.617))/40311.6=100.59% of the systems total energy.

E)
We want to add a term to our equation for the force so we avoid particles
almost being on top of eachother and thus creating the problem of 
particles escaping with huge velocities. It also makes particles lump together
as they can't shoot past eachother when they are very close.

Adding this term epsilon to the denominator has done wonders for our algorithm.
We no longer observe particles that have escaped with such velocities
that the potential and kinetic energies of bound particles look
like constants. We observe a sharp decrease in the number of particles that
have been ejected, at 200 it has gone from 24.5% to 4%. The biggest change being
50 particle system where we previously had 32% we now have 0% ejected particles.

We look at the energies and following the trend we described above, it's only
expected that the energies of the ejected particles also decrease sharply.

We measure the energy of the ejected particles versus the energy of the
total system and observe:
6.7% of the systems total energy for 200 particles 
7.22% of the systems total energy for 150 particles
3.51% of the systems total energy for 100 particles
0% of the systems total energy for 50 particles

For 200 particles:
8 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
(-526722+562032)/526722=6.7% of the systems total energy.

for 150 particles:
6 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
(-395889+424488)/395889=7.22% of the systems total energy.

for 100 particles:
2 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
(-260865+270044)/260865=3.51% of the systems total energy.


for 50 particles:
0 out particles are ejected out of 45 ly radius. Their energies are: 
0% of the systems total energy.
