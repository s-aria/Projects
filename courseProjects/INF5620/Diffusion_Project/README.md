Diffusion project 2014

main.py:
	 file is not meant to be run it contains the solver in question and also contains a line for plotting that I will come back to later.

test_constant.py:
	contains the constant test also a plotting line, which is commented out but you can uncomment it if you wish so.
	you can run this file for the values pre-chosen values or you can change them in the file

test_exact.py:
	I have an explanation inside the code as well in addition to this readme file. You can run this file as well as it is.
	However I have defined several variables dim1, dim2 and error which one can change by boolean to choose what you would like to run and test

test_gaussian.py:
	this too can be run as it is but as I mentioned before running make sure line in the main.py is uncommented which is used to animate the solution for this gaussian case

test_manufactured.py:
	Can be run, I have a few chosen values for the T already there, but of course one may change them as one pleases. 
	Also it is made so it runs through a list containing the different T's this was done to get the different errors at the first element on the terminal.
